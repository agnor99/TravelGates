# TravelGates
  
## Description  
The purpose of this mod is to allow players to create a network of teleportation pads that let them travel long distances very quickly.  
Players are able to use the custom UI on each gate to configure it with an ID and a destination., as well as a blacklist/whitelist for gate access.
  
## Gates  
There are currently two types of gates in the mod: The "Gate" and the "Quick Gate".  
The only difference in usage between the two is that once you place the quick gate and configure it, you cannot change any of its configurations until it is harvested and placed again.  
The "Gate" can be configured after placing by right clicking on it.  
Quick Gates are emerald Green and Gates are diamond blue.
